\section{Questions and Methods}
\label{sec:methodology}
To answer the questions we outlined in the introduction, we wrote three simple programs for each of LLVM MCJIT, JitBuilder, and a straight forward native implementation without a JIT framework.
The programs are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item increment - Calls a single function that adds one to an integer argument.
    \item recursive-fib - Calls a recursive fibonacci function for \textit{fib(20)}.
    \item iterative-fib - Calls an iterative fibonacci function for \textit{fib(20)}.  
\end{itemize}
For the JIT implementations, the functions were created using the provided API's, then native code was generated and later used for the actual function call.
We built and benchmarked the programs on an x86-64 Linux workstation with 32gb of RAM and an Intel 6 Core (12 thread) processor. 
Both LLVM, and OMR were built from source from their respective Github repositories \cite{llvmCommit, omrCommit}.
All the source code for this project can be found online through Github\cite{projectGithub}.
