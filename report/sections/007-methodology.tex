\section{Questions and Methods}
\label{sec:methodology}
To answer the questions we outlined in the introduction, we wrote three applications with JitBuilder, LLVM MCJIT and native (written directly in C), for a total of 9 programs.
The programs are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Simple - A program with a single function that adds one to an integer argument.
    \item Recursive-Fib - A recursive fibonacci implementation.
    \item Iterative-Fib - An iterative fibonacci implementation. 
\end{itemize}

We built and benchmarked the programs on an x86-64 Linux workstation with 32gb of RAM, and an Intel 6 Core (12 thread) processor. LLVM was from source using version 10.0\cite{llvmCommit}, while OMR was built from source using the recent master branch\cite{omrCommit}.
