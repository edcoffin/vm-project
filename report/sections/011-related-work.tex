Given the overhead involved in fetching, decoding, and executing instructions, interpreters are a common place we see JIT compilers employed.
Java Virtual Machines \cite{HiPerfJava,SuganumaIBMJit} have been employing JIT compilers for over two decades.
Numba is a Python JIT compiler based on LLVM \cite{numba,numbaWeb}, while the PyPy project has it's own tracing JIT \cite{pypy}.
JitBuilder has been used on several demonstration interpreters \cite{lua-vermhela, wasmjit}, while ongoing work continues to build new runtimes, or to bolster existing runtimes with it's parent project Eclipse ORM \cite{ruby-omr}.

Currently there is work being done to allow JitBuilder to ingest LLVM IR \cite{llvm-jitbuilder-interop}. 
Not only would this allow JitBuilder to bolt onto existing LLVM based projects, it would help provide deeper insight into the quality of the generated between the two frameworks.
