Given the overhead involved in fetching, decoding, and executing instructions, interpreters are a commonplace we see JIT compilers employed.
Java Virtual Machines \cite{HiPerfJava,SuganumaIBMJit} have been employing JIT compilers for over two decades, while the Python world has both
Numba, a Python JIT compiler based on LLVM \cite{numba,numbaWeb}, and the PyPy project -- a Python interpreter with its own tracing JIT \cite{pypy}.

JitBuilder has been integrated into several demonstration interpreters \cite{lua-vermhela, wasmjit, base9}, while work is ongoing to build new runtimes or to bolster existing runtimes with its parent project, Eclipse ORM \cite{ruby-omr}.

There is also work being done to allow JitBuilder to ingest LLVM IR \cite{llvm-jitbuilder-interop}. 
Not only would this allow JitBuilder to bolt onto existing LLVM based projects, but it could also help provide deeper insight into the quality and differences of the generated code between the two frameworks.
