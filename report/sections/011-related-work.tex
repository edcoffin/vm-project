Given the overhead involved in fetching, decoding, and executing instructions, interpreters are a common place we see JIT compilers employed.
Java Virtual Machines \cite{HiPerfJava,SuganumaIBMJit} have been employing JIT compilers for over two decades, while the Python world has both
Numba, a Python JIT compiler based on LLVM \cite{numba,numbaWeb}, and the PyPy project -- a Python interpreter with it's own tracing JIT \cite{pypy}.

JitBuilder has been integrated in several demonstration interpreters \cite{lua-vermhela, wasmjit, base9}, while work is ongoing to build new runtimes, or to bolster existing runtimes with it's parent project, Eclipse ORM \cite{ruby-omr}.

There is also work being done to allow JitBuilder to ingest LLVM IR \cite{llvm-jitbuilder-interop}. 
Not only would this allow JitBuilder to bolt onto existing LLVM based projects, it could help provide deeper insight into the quality of the generated code between the two frameworks.
