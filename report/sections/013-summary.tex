\section{Summary}
\label{sec:summary}
Considering the JIT compiler behind JitBuilder was designed specifically for dynamic runtime compilation, it makes sense that it has a lighter footprint than MCJIT, which shares it's codebase with the static compiler for LLVM
Unlike LLVM's IR, which is meant for life-long usage, the design of OMR's IR does not have ahead of time, or offline goals in mind, thus
possibly simplifying the work required whenever IR interactions are made in JitBuilder.
