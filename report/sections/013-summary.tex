\section{Summary}
\label{sec:summary}
Considering the JIT compiler behind JitBuilder was designed specifically for dynamic runtime compilation, it makes sense that it has a lighter footprint than MCJIT, which shares it's codebase with the static compiler for LLVM.
Unlike LLVM's IR, which is meant for life-long usage, the design of OMR's IR does not necessarily have ahead of time, or offline goals in mind.
We believe this simplifies the work required when IR interactions are made in JitBuilder and may give it a performance edge as a dynamic compiler over MCJIT.
The code generated by MCJIT did outperform JitBuilder is some cases.
